# Reolink Duo 3 PoE — build log / artifact tracker

Firmware `.pak` files are **not** committed (see `.gitignore`). They live under
`~/Downloads/Reolink_Duo_3_PoE_2505072124/`. This file tracks what each built
artifact contains, its sha256, and where it is, so we always know what to flash
or recover to.

> ⚠️ **The camera validates the `.pak` FILENAME.** Local Upgrade rejects any name not
> matching `IPC_NT15NA416MP.<build>_2505072124.Reolink-Duo-3-PoE.16MP.REOLINK*.pak`
> with **"Failed to recognize the file format"** — regardless of valid CRC/contents.
> The short `soccercam_*.pak` names under `…/BUILT/` are **byte-identical** to the
> correctly-named copies in the parent dir but **will NOT flash**. Always flash the
> `IPC_NT15NA416MP.…REOLINK…` name. (Confirmed on-camera 2026-06-29: same sha256, only
> the name differed — `soccercam_SIMPLE_fixes_4897.pak` rejected,
> `IPC_…4897…_soccercam_v2.pak` accepted.)

## Recovery artifacts (`…/RECOVERY/`)
| File | sha256 | What |
|---|---|---|
| `FACTORY_STOCK_4867.pak` | `1668c9df…` | Untouched stock Reolink firmware — factory recovery, always works. |
| `CURRENT_WORKING_netstate_4896.pak` | `678c1224…` | Reproduces the camera's pre-2026-06-29 live config (v1 netstate daemon + home router MAC [redacted — see netstate README on MAC discovery] + HTTP `/downloadfile/` unlock + 20480 bitrate). Flash to restore "what we had". |

## "Simple fixes" firmware — BUILT, ready to flash (`…/BUILT/`)
| File | sha256 |
|---|---|
| `soccercam_SIMPLE_fixes_4897.pak` (= `IPC_NT15NA416MP.4897_…_soccercam_v2.pak`) | `da14af6e…` |

Contents (layered on stock 4867):
- HTTP `/downloadfile/` unlock (carried)
- Main-stream bitrate cap 20480 kbps (carried)
- **`S99_NetState` v2** — home/away recording **+ home power-on stub cleanup** (deletes the boot-window stub created at home, only files newer than this boot)
- **Free-space reserve 500 MiB → 20 GiB** — one-instruction patch in `libStorageFileManager.so` `Get_storage_space` (`d2a3e800`→`a000c0d2` @ file off `0x44788`). Fixes mid-game **truncation**: the overwrite now keeps 20 GB free so the 8K main stream's 780 MB segment writes never fail.

Build: `builds/build_soccercam_v2.sh` (driven by `/tmp` wrapper that carries creds/MAC from 4896).

## "Comprehensive" firmware — ready to flash
| File | sha256 | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **`IPC_NT15NA416MP.4901_…REOLINK_soccercam_comprehensive.pak`** | `acf0ce7e…` | **CURRENT / recommended.** Audio recovery + netstate hardening (`INIT_GRACE=5`, fail-enabled retry) + **build manifest** (`/etc/soccercam_build` → `/downloadfile/soccercam/build.txt`), now surfaced *after* the SD card mounts. CRC `0x1354234d`, commit `4f5c97f`. |
| `IPC_…4900…` | `9f245cf8…` | superseded. **Flash-verified on camera 2026-06-29** (netstate v2 + fail-enabled fixes confirmed working), but the manifest surfaced too early at boot so `build.txt` didn't appear — fixed in 4901. CRC `0x086a57e2`. |
| `IPC_…4899…` (= `BUILT/soccercam_COMPREHENSIVE_4899.pak`) | `52ed6ac5…` | prior — audio recovery; pre-manifest, `INIT_GRACE=45`, old (latching) netstate loop. CRC `0x70ef529f`. |
| `IPC_…4898…` (= `BUILT/soccercam_COMPREHENSIVE_4898.pak`) | `6e96223d…` | video-only recovery @ fixed 20 fps. **Flash-verified on the camera 2026-06-29.** |

Everything in the simple-fixes pak **plus** boot-time power-cut recovery:
- **`/usr/bin/recover_mp4`** — static aarch64 reindexer (no runtime deps). Conservative NAL-chaining walk rebuilds the **video** track from a moov-less mdat (audio bytes can't be mislabeled as video), copies hvc1/hvcC + box templates from a reference good recording on the card, appends a valid moov in place under the original `RecM09…` name. Loses ≤1 GOP (~2 s).
  - **AUDIO (4899+):** the camera interleaves strict V-A-V-A… with each audio chunk a run of raw AAC-LC frames starting exactly at the preceding video chunk's end. The same walk that skips audio to resync video yields each audio chunk's byte range; **Helix AAC** (`AACDecode`, bytes-consumed == frame size) splits them into a real `soun` trak. A plausible-size + outputSamps + stream-param filter rejects the unreferenced padding hole that trails each chunk. Static-linked `libhelixaac.a` (Helix is RPSL, fetched locally — see `recover/helix/README.md`); absent → builder falls back to `-DNO_AUDIO` video-only.
  - **Timing (4899+):** video frame spacing is derived from the **audio clock** (audio duration / N video frames) instead of a fixed FPS — the recorded rate varies with exposure (this test clip is 12.5 fps, not the configured 20), so this matches the real wall-clock duration and keeps A/V in sync. Falls back to 20 fps only when no audio was recovered.
  - **Truncation fix (4899+):** rewrites the `mdat` box size to the real (power-cut-shortened) content length + `ftruncate`s before appending moov, so players don't hunt for moov past the lost data ("moov atom not found").
  - **Validated end-to-end** (actual aarch64 binary extracted from the 4899 pak, run via qemu, decoded with ffmpeg):
    - *Clean orphan* → 432 video / 35 kf + 539 audio frames; **byte-perfect** vs reference (0/432 video, 0/539 audio size mismatches); recovered **audio PCM is bit-identical** to the reference (md5 `b0a31583…`); 0 decode errors; 34.49 s @ 12.5 fps, A/V synced.
    - *Power-cut orphan* (1.3 MB tail chopped) → 412 video / 510 audio, 0 decode errors, video 32.64 s == audio 32.64 s (best-effort: drops the partial trailing frames).
- **`/etc/init.d/S35_RecRecover`** — at boot (before the camera's scan), finds a reference, recovers each orphan in place, renames the end-time to the recovered duration so the camera's duration check passes, re-indexes as a normal `/downloadfile/` video. **Never deletes** a recoverable file; leaves unparseable ones in place.
- **`/etc/soccercam_build`** (4900+) — build manifest (variant, options, git commit), copied to `/mnt/sda/soccercam/build.txt` at boot by `S99_NetState`. Identify which firmware a camera runs over the HTTP unlock: `curl http://<cam>/downloadfile/soccercam/build.txt` (every pak otherwise reports the same stock `v3.0.0.4867` version string).

Build: `builds/build_soccercam_comprehensive.sh` (source `recover/recover_mp4.c` + `recover/helix/`, `runtime/recover/S35_RecRecover`). 4900 verified pak contents: recover_mp4 (aarch64, +x, Helix-linked 847 KB), S35_RecRecover, S99_NetState v2 (`INIT_GRACE=5` + fail-enabled retry), `/etc/soccercam_build` manifest, http unlock, bitrate 20480, reserve 20 GiB; rootfs 5.75 MB < 8 MB partition; CRC `0x1354234d` verified (4901).

Known limits: main stream (`RecM09`, H.265) only; `RecS09` sub-stream recovery is a follow-on. Audio is best-effort — a corrupt audio chunk drops that chunk's sound (video unaffected).
